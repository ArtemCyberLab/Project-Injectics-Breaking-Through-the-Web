I explored the Injectics web application, testing it for vulnerabilities. The site had only login and admin pages available, and analyzing the source code revealed the existence of a mail.log file, hinting at a possible data leak. Running Gobuster and Dirsearch, I found several interesting directories, including /flags, /phpmyadmin, and mail.log itself, which contained credentials: superadmin@injectics.thm : superSecurePasswd101 and dev@injectics.thm : devPasswd123. However, the credentials were useless as long as the users table existed. Testing for SQL injection in Burp Suite, I found a working payload that allowed me to log in as dev. The next step was simpleâ€”I deleted the users table using DROP TABLE users -- -, then logged in as superadmin and obtained the first flag. Next, I checked for SSTI by changing the profile name to {{2*2}}, which returned 4, confirming the vulnerability. Using Twig, I executed {{['ls /var/www/html/flags',""]|sort('passthru')}} and {{['cat /var/www/html/flags/5d8af1dc14503c7e4bdc8e51a3469f48.txt',""]|sort('passthru')}}, revealing the final flag. The SQL injection and SSTI vulnerabilities allowed me to fully compromise the system, demonstrating how dangerous these attacks can be when web applications are poorly secured.
